/*
Given two strings S1 & S2, search for an occurrence of the second string within a first string.  

Note: Do not use system library for the implementation. 

 

Input:
    Code Zinger University 
    Zinger

 

    where, 

First line represents string S1. 
Second line represents string S2. 
 

Output:
    5 

 

Here 'Zinger' word starts at 5th index within 'Code Zinger Universityâ€™. 

 

Assume that, 

The length of strings S1 & S2 are within the range [1 to 10000].
Character comparisons will be case-sensitive.
